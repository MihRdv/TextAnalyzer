On the 24th of February, 1815, the lookout at Notre-Dame de la Garde signaled the three-master, the Pharaon, from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples.
As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d’If, got on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.
Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come into port, especially when, like the Pharaon, it has been built, rigged, and laden in the old Phocaean city, and belongs to a shipowner of the town.
The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled Pomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board.
However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel itself, for she bore down with all the evidence of being admirably handled, the anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by the side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each direction of the pilot.
The vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled alongside the Pharaon, which he reached as she rounded into La Réserve basin.
When the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his station by the pilot, and hat in hand leaned over the ship’s bulwarks.
He was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black eyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.
“Ah, is it you, Dantès?” cried the man in the skiff.
“What’s the matter? And why have you such an air of sadness aboard?”
“A great misfortune, M. Morrel,” replied the young man, “a great misfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave Captain Leclere.”
“And the cargo?” inquired the owner, eagerly.
“It is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that head. But poor Captain Leclere—”
“What happened to him?” asked the owner, with an air of considerable resignation.
“What happened to the worthy captain?”
“He died of brain fever, in dreadful agony.”
Then turning to the crew, he said, “Bear a hand there, to take in sail!”
All hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and topsail halyards, the young man giving a vigorous sweep with the end of a rope, and casting off the spanker brails himself, “Down with the topsails!” shouted the pilot.
All hands obeyed, and the topsails were furled, and the ship found herself moored at last.
M. Morrel had fallen into deep thought.
“Ah, Dantès,” said he, “Captain Leclere was a brave and an honest man, and it is a great loss to your crew and to the ship’s owner. But he left a widow, did he not?”
“No, sir, he had no one to mourn for him except us, the crew, who loved him so much. He was a father to us, and would have died for us willingly, I am sure. But now we must go on with the unloading of the ship. I shall come to the office as soon as we are done, M. Morrel.”
Morrel nodded, then stepped off the ship, leaving Dantès and his men to finish the task.
Unbeknownst to all, this was the beginning of a great change for Dantès.
For when he stepped ashore, he had no idea that he would soon be swept into a whirlwind of betrayal, imprisonment, and revenge that would transform him from a simple sailor into the powerful and enigmatic Count of Monte Cristo.
The story of Edmond Dantès is one of the most thrilling and dramatic tales ever told.
It is a story of love, betrayal, and vengeance.
It is a story of a man wronged, who rises from the ashes of his former life to exact his revenge on those who had destroyed him.
And it is a story of redemption, as Dantès ultimately learns that revenge is a bitter and empty pursuit, and that forgiveness is the true path to peace and happiness.
But before he can learn these lessons, Dantès must first pass through many trials and tribulations.
He must suffer greatly, and he must lose everything, before he can gain the wisdom that will guide him to his final redemption.
And so begins the tale of the Count of Monte Cristo, a tale of adventure, intrigue, and suspense that has captivated readers for generations.
As we follow Dantès on his journey, we will see him grow from a naive and trusting young man into a hardened and ruthless avenger.
We will see him confront his enemies, and we will see him ultimately triumph over them.
But we will also see him struggle with the darkness in his own heart, as he comes to realize that the path of revenge is fraught with danger and peril.
For in seeking to destroy his enemies, Dantès risks becoming like them.
And in the end, he must decide whether to continue down the path of vengeance, or to turn away from it and seek a different path.
This is the central conflict of the story, and it is what makes the tale of the Count of Monte Cristo so compelling.
It is a story that speaks to the human condition, and to the choices that we all must make in our own lives.
For who among us has not been wronged, and who among us has not felt the desire for revenge?
But as Dantès learns, revenge is a double-edged sword, and it can cut both ways.
In seeking to harm others, we may end up harming ourselves.
And in the end, we must ask ourselves, is revenge worth the price?
This is the question that Edmond Dantès must answer, and it is the question that we all must answer, in our own lives.
As we follow Dantès on his journey, we will see him face many challenges, and we will see him make many choices.
Some of these choices will lead him down the path of darkness, while others will lead him toward the light.
And in the end, it is up to us to decide which path we will follow.
Will we choose revenge, or will we choose forgiveness?
Will we seek to destroy our enemies, or will we seek to redeem them?
This is the great question of the story, and it is a question that we must all ask ourselves, as we journey through life.
