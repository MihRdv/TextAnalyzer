In 1815, M. Charles-François-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of Digne.
He was an old man of about seventy-five years of age; he had occupied the bishopric of Digne since 1806.
Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely for the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese.
True or false, that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and above all in their destinies, as that which they do.
M. Myriel was the son of a councilor of the Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar.
It was said that his father, destining him for the magistracy, had married him at a very early age, eighteen or twenty, in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families.
In spite of this marriage, however, it was said that Charles Myriel created a great deal of talk.
He was well-formed, though of slight build, elegant, graceful, and witty; the earlier part of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry.
The Revolution came; events hurried on; the parliamentary families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, scattered, disappeared.
M. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very beginning of the Revolution.
There his wife died of a malady of the chest, from which she had long suffered.
He had no children.
What took place next in the destiny of M. Myriel?
The ruin of the French society of the olden days, the fall of the dynasty of the Bourbons, the downfall of the nobility which was formerly so glittering, so haughty, so great, that terrible crash of society in 1793, after which all disappeared—father, wife, sister, and country—all vanished in the gulf of that revolution which devoured all that one could have called social happiness—left M. Myriel at first completely stunned, bewildered, lost.
His personal and family misfortunes were enough to shatter his mind.
But a few months after the death of his wife, M. Myriel was appointed as the Bishop of Digne.
How this appointment came to him was a subject of much conversation at the time.
It was rumored that the First Consul himself, Napoleon Bonaparte, made the appointment, favoring M. Myriel in consequence of some important services rendered by the latter.
These services remained a mystery; and none of his acquaintances ever succeeded in finding out the details of them.
Be that as it may, M. Myriel was crowned with the mitre at the age of fifty, having previously been but a simple parish priest.
The sensation caused by the elevation of such a man to the episcopate was great.
A few old women said, “He is a saint.”
But the more discerning said, “He is an ambitious man.”

He was, in fact, a remarkable man, with an earnest and sincere religious spirit.
From the very beginning, his charity had a contagious effect.
He was, however, considered by many to be a bit eccentric.
He turned away no man from his door.
He slept little, spoke rarely, prayed constantly, lived almost entirely on herbs and vegetables, and kept no wine in his house.
He was constantly visiting the sick and the poor, often going without his own supper to give to those in need.
He had refused a more prominent position in the Church.
The Bishop of Digne lived with an extraordinary simplicity.
He possessed no furniture, but instead had chosen to live in a small room with bare walls.
The furniture was a few straw-bottomed chairs, a wooden table, and a bed of hard boards.
Despite this austerity, his influence spread rapidly, and he became loved by many.
This manner of life soon gained him widespread admiration and fame.
People came from all corners of the country to see the simple bishop.
He was loved, feared, and respected.
He had turned his palace into a hospital.
He was known to sleep on the floor beside the beds of the sick.
His devotion was unparalleled.
Every day, he could be found ministering to the poor, visiting the jails, and talking to the prisoners.
His mercy had no limits.
It was said that he could bring comfort to anyone.
People called him a saint.
But M. Myriel never thought of himself in such terms.
He remained humble and modest in his actions.
His only thought was for others.
His charity extended even to animals.
He would go out of his way to help a stray dog or a wounded bird.
The city of Digne began to flourish under his care.
Crime decreased.
The poor were taken care of.
The sick were nursed back to health.
The city became a model of compassion and kindness.
M. Myriel was at the center of it all.
He had become a beacon of hope for the people.
He was loved by all, feared by none.
He had become a legend in his own time.
But M. Myriel remained humble.
He continued to live simply, never seeking fame or recognition.
He was content to serve others.
And serve he did, until the end of his days.
He died as he had lived, quietly, without fanfare.
His legacy, however, lived on.
The people of Digne would never forget the man who had brought hope and light to their city.
His name would be remembered for generations to come.
And the city of Digne would remain a symbol of compassion and kindness for years to come.
